**insert body here** 

Your instructor will provide guidance on how to obtain your Microsoft 365 credentials in your lab-hosted environment. You will use these credentials throughout the remaining labs in this course.

In your lab environment, your lab hosting provider has already:

- Deployed the trial tenant
- Created a default tenant administrator account (known as the MOD Administrator)
- Created 9 additional user accounts

In order to configure Lab 1:

1. On **LON-CL1**, you must select **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** to log in (your instructor will guide you on how to find this option in your VM environment). Log into LON-CL1 as the local Adatum administrator account that was created by your lab hosting provider (**Administrator**) with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Once logged into **LON-CL1**, open the folder on the desktop named **Lab Scripts** and then the subfolder named **Lab 1**. In the **Lab 1** subfolder a .bat file named **Lab1setup.bat** should exist.

    Right-click **Lab1setup.bat** and then select **Run as administrator** to start the lab setup process. 

    **Note:** If a **Windows protected your PC** pop-up warning is displayed, select **More info** and then select **Run anyway** at the bottum of the pop-up to continue. A **Lab 1 setup** window will appear on the screen.

3. After about 30 seconds (and up to 1 minute), a Microsoft Sign-on prompt will appear. Log in as **admin@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider). On the **Enter password** window, enter the tenant admin password provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

    **Important:** The **Lab 1 setup** process has a time-out of 5 minutes. If you fail to type in your credentials within this 5 minute time frame, a pop-up message displaying **Lab Setup Failed. EXITING...** will appear. Click **Ok**, close the Microsoft Sign-on window, and repeat step 2. 

4. Once the lab setup process has completed, a pop-up message displaying **Lab Setup Completed. EXITING...** will appear. Select **Ok** and proceed to **Exercise 1, Task 1**

    **Note:** It could take the full 5 minute time-frame for the lab setup process to complete.
